# loan-approval-prediction
# Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to Develop Machine Learning model to predict accurately wheather a loan application is going to reject or accepte  onn various loan related  factor like loan amount , Education , Applicant Income and CoApplicant income  , Loan Amount ETC
# Key Components:
### Data Collection: 
Collect historical loan application data, including information about applicants (e.g., age, income, credit score, employment status) and loan characteristics (e.g., loan amount, interest rate). This data will serve as the basis for training and testing the machine learning model.

### Data Preprocessing: 
Clean, transform, and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure it is in a suitable format for machine learning. This may include feature engineering and encoding categorical variables.

### Model Development:
Build and train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data. Consider various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks. Tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
